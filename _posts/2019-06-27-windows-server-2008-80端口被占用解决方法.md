If you try `netstat -abn | more` you will not get a process name.

    TCP 0.0.0.0:80 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING

Can not obtain ownership information

     netstat -aon | find "TCP" | find ":80" showed me Process ID 4 which means SYSTEM. wtf?

Outputs:

    TCP    0.0.0.0:80             0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       4
    TCP    0.0.0.0:8080           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       4836
    TCP    10.214.164.247:1076    140.206.78.8:80        ESTABLISHED     3440
    TCP    10.214.164.247:1099    36.110.231.46:80       ESTABLISHED     3424
    TCP    10.214.164.247:1143    140.206.78.18:80       ESTABLISHED     4300
    TCP    10.214.164.247:1273    140.206.78.20:80       ESTABLISHED     5252
    TCP    10.214.164.247:1310    223.167.166.61:80      ESTABLISHED     3440
    TCP    10.214.164.247:1331    223.167.166.56:80      ESTABLISHED     4300
    TCP    10.214.164.247:1359    54.243.113.215:80      ESTABLISHED     3432
    TCP    10.214.164.247:1362    54.243.113.215:80      ESTABLISHED     3432
    TCP    [::]:80                [::]:0                 LISTENING       4

Next try:

Device Manager --> Menu View --> Show hidden Devices

Open Non-Plug and Play Drivers, select HTTP and open the properties.
If you try to stop the driver you will be shown a list of other services depending on HTTP which would also be stopped - not good...

After some googling I found the solution:

    netsh http add iplisten ipaddress=::

This works instantly and I did not recognize any side effects yet.
